# Introduction
This is myRan's first personal website, mainly documenting some learning-related matters. The learning mainly involves computer-related courses (such as computer architecture principles), possibly including some specialized courses(for instance, computer organization and design), some mathematics-related courses(such as optimization methods), and some project descriptions.If I have enough time, I will also write some blogs.

# Language
In order to enhance my English proficiency, I will attempt to write in English. Of course, I will start by writing in Chinese first to clarify the logic of the writing! Therefore, if you come arcoss any expressions in Chinglish, please feel free to [email](mailto:myRan_NUAA_cs@163.com) me and I would be very grateful to you! Any other mistakes are the same.
